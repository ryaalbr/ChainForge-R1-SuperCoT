# R1 + Super CoT: ChainForge

![ChainForge](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b6d4341-f632-41d5-9117-a82a9a4b983a)

A multi-stage pipeline that integrates **DeepSeek Reasoner** and **Anthropic Claude** for enhanced chain-of-thought data generation, built on **Qwen2.5** language models. Inspired by the [DeepSeek-R1 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948), it showcases:

1. **Hybrid CoT Generation** using DeepSeek + Anthropic expansions
2. **Cold-Start SFT** using enhanced CoT data
3. **Reasoning-Oriented RL** (GRPO) for improved correctness
4. **Rejection Sampling** to gather top responses
5. **Additional SFT** on filtered data
6. **Final RL** for broad scenarios
7. **Optional Distillation** to smaller Qwen2.5 checkpoints

## What is Super Chain of Thought?

Super Chain of Thought (Super CoT) is an enhanced reasoning framework that combines DeepSeek's chain-of-thought capabilities with selective Anthropic expansions and reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional CoT which simply shows reasoning steps, Super CoT:

1. **Structured Reasoning**: Uses DeepSeek's <think> tags with Anthropic expansions for uncertain steps
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Applies RL to improve reasoning quality over multiple stages
3. **Quality Control**: Implements rejection sampling to filter and keep only the best reasoning paths
4. **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfers learned reasoning patterns to smaller, more efficient models

## Anthropic Integration Details

The integration of Anthropic Claude adds a crucial layer of reasoning enhancement to our pipeline:

### 1. Uncertainty Detection

* **Automatic Detection**: Scans reasoning steps for uncertainty markers like:
  * "maybe", "not sure", "guess", "uncertain", "unsure"
  * Length-based heuristics for complex steps
  * Domain-specific uncertainty signals
* **Selective Expansion**: Only expands steps that need clarification
* **Preservation of Clear Reasoning**: Leaves well-reasoned steps untouched

### 2. Expansion Process

1. **Input Processing**:
   ```python
   # Original DeepSeek step
   <think>This might be related to quantum tunneling, but I'm not sure...</think>

   # Anthropic expansion request
   "Please provide a factual grounding of why this step might be correct..."

   # Final expanded format
   <think>Original step
   <explanation>Anthropic's detailed grounding</explanation>
   </think>
   ```

2. **Integration Points**:
   * During initial CoT collection
   * In rejection sampling phase
   * During final model distillation

### 3. Implementation Details

1. **API Integration**:
   ```python
   # Setup
   anthropic_client = anthropic.Client(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])

   # Expansion call
   expansion = anthropic_client.completions.create(
       model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
       max_tokens=512,
       prompt=f"Explain why this step is valid: {uncertain_step}"
   )
   ```

2. **Error Handling**:
   * Graceful fallbacks to original reasoning
   * Rate limiting protection
   * Context length management
   * Expansion validation

3. **Best Practices**:
   * Keep expansions concise (≤512 tokens)
   * Focus on factual grounding
   * Maintain reasoning flow
   * Preserve original insights

## Overview

**R1 + Super CoT: ChainForge** follows the methodology of **DeepSeek-R1** to enhance a Qwen2.5 model's reasoning abilities via reinforcement learning (RL). We:

1. Retrieve high-quality **chain-of-thought** (CoT) from DeepSeek Reasoner's `reasoning_content`
2. Use it for a "cold-start" **supervised fine-tuning** (SFT)
3. Conduct **Reasoning-Oriented RL** to boost correctness and clarity
4. Utilize **rejection sampling** to pick the best RL outputs
5. Perform **additional SFT** on these curated samples
6. Optionally **distill** the final large model into a smaller Qwen2.5 checkpoint

> **Note**: This is a reference pipeline. For production usage, expand datasets, scale RL steps, and incorporate advanced reward modeling.

***

## Features

* **DeepSeek Reasoner Integration**:
  * Automates CoT collection via `reasoning_content`
  * Properly handles <think> tags in chain-of-thought
  * Maintains clean conversation history without reasoning feedback
* **Qwen2.5-7B** Base Model: Hugging Face model with RoPE and large context support
* **Group-based RL**: A GRPO-like approach for stable reinforcement training
* **Rejection Sampling**: Extracts best RL completions for further SFT
* **Distillation**: Compress final RL knowledge into smaller Qwen2.5 variants
